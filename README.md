# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This repo contains several files, of which run_analysis.R is the most important. It takes data from the Data-folder, cleans it in a way described in the comments in the file, and produces two data frames, merge_set and mean_set. merge_set is a merged set of both test and training data with all partipants in the study, while mean set is a condensed set only containing the means of each observation for each participant activity. 

The data-folder contains the data in a subfolder, which is used in the script. If moving the data to another place, remember to also change the script aswell.
